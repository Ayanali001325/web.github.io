    <h1>Website about laptop</h1>
    <p>A laptop is a personal computer that can be easily moved and used in a variety of locations
        . Most laptops are designed to have all of the functionality of a desktop computer
        , which means they can generally run the same software and open the same types of files.</p><br>
